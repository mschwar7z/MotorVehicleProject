Hello!

This is my first ever project that I'm posting to GitHub! What an exciting day :)

With all the projects I could've done, this sure isn't one of the exciting ones. However, that's why it's exciting that I have so many more things to 
create in my lifetime.Today marks the beginning of my journey in becoming a software developer with refined skills. The day will come when I look back at 
myself and say "Wow! You didit Mia." And, I'm looking forward to the many days that I see myself like that. Nothing says growth more than seeing that 
change within yourself. 

I hope you, reader, can look at this and appreciate the stepping stones that a novice goes through in order to achieve excellence. It takes a little bit of time
to grow into a better software engineer. It's not an easy feat when your brain chooses to think distractedly. Talk about ADHD. However, it's always possible
to get better at something. With that, I hope you find something to learn through my project process. 

I'm on a journey where only determination will pave my path.
